# 👋 Hi, I’m Hritik Patil

I’m a Data Science graduate student with a strong interest in **machine learning, healthcare analytics, and real-world ML deployment**.  
I enjoy taking raw datasets, building end-to-end ML pipelines, and turning them into **deployable apps** using tools like Streamlit and Flask.

##  Featured Projects

###  Heart Failure Prediction  
**Repo:** [heart_failure](https://github.com/Hritik827/heart_failure)  

- Built a machine learning model using clinical records to **predict risk of heart failure**.  
- Includes a **training notebook**, model artifacts, and a **deployment-ready app (`app.py`)**.  
- Packaged with `requirements.txt` so it can be easily reproduced and deployed.

---

###  Medical Insurance Cost Prediction  
**Repo:** [medical_cost_project](https://github.com/Hritik827/medical_cost_project)  

- Predicts **medical insurance charges** based on features like age, BMI, region, and smoking status.  
- Trained regression models and evaluated performance using metrics stored in the `artifacts/` folder.  
- Contains a **Streamlit/Flask-style app script** (`app.py`) to make the model interactive for end users.

### Cocoa Leaf Disease Detection (Computer Vision)  
**Repo:** [Cocoa_Leaf_Disease_Detection](https://github.com/Hritik827/Cocoa_Leaf_Disease_Detection)  

- Developed a **deep learning–based image classifier** for cocoa leaf diseases (e.g., healthy vs. Anthracnose vs. CSSVD). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Experimented with multiple CNN architectures like **EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet**, and saved the best-performing models.  
- Includes training notebooks, inference scripts, and example leaf images.

---

###  Resume Classification (NLP Application)  
**Repo:** [Resume-Classification](https://github.com/Hritik827/Resume-Classification)  

- Built an **NLP model to categorize resumes** into different job/skill categories. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Includes dataset, deployment files, and a demo video showing the app in action.  
- Designed to help automate **screening of candidate resumes** based on content.

###  Predictive Maintenance – Machine Failure Prediction  
**Repo:** [Predictive-Maintenance-Machine-Failure-Prediction](https://github.com/Hritik827/Predictive-Maintenance-Machine-Failure-Prediction)  

- End-to-end **predictive maintenance system** using a **Random Forest model** to detect machine failures from sensor data. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training**, and deployment via a simple app.  
- Includes saved models (`rf_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`) and a Jupyter Notebook walkthrough.
